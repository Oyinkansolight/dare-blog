A friend of mine complained bitterly about his business and that things are not working as planned. I told him to have other streams of income. Whenever I look at his approach to his business,he needs to think in the other person's shoes. People are ready to pay you,so long they maximize their products or services.

The world keeps evolving everyday,as an entrepreneur one must think in the customer's mind,offer good content and keep the product attractive.

As an entrepreneur,there are sacrifices need to be made,create valuable friendship and offer more to the human mind as incentive,they would keep coming and asking for more content.

This was what I did to one meat pie I bought,it really made sense. I ate it and enjoyed being the clients.

As a writer, since we are all writers and have products or service that we want to avail for sale.

We have to think of various means to get our products to the end clients.

The beauty of any product is to meet the customer's satisfaction. Whenever it rains on the ground,it produces plant. It's God who had blessed every human for His great love. As human we all have unique gifts,and these gifts,when used judiciously, it's a way to say thank You to God,when we spread the love,by being a blessing to others.

The Xmas period is around the corner. People have been asking,how would we celebrate our Online Story Telling Platform clients. We are praying God gives us a unique way to celebrate our friends on this platform.

Thinking like a customer,gives you an illustration of a child that's painting. If he or she sees another painter,he or she would appreciate,all things being equal.

We try to look why a customer would not patronize you?

👉 price
👉 Income
👉 Product
👉 Season
👉 Technology
👉 "4 5 1"

Customers are always the king. You treat well. If they want to dance💃💃💃💃🕺🕺🕺🕺,give them the right song.

The best product might not sell the best market,but close customer like 5 and 6,would offer you his 💰,if you give free content.
